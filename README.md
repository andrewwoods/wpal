# WPAL - WordPress AutoLoader plugin

__Modernize your WordPress development__

A PHP Class Namespace auto loader helps modernize your code. PHP developers
outside the WordPress community use autoloading to make it easier to manage
their code. Since WordPress doesn't yet have an autoloader in core, this is one
that plugin and theme authors can use for their projects.

Simply put, it removes the need to add require or include statements for each PHP class
you want to use in your plugin.
